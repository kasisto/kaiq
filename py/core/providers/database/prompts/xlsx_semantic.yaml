    Create a searchable index description for this spreadsheet data.

    This description is ONLY for search matching - the raw data will be provided separately as the authoritative source.

    Include for search matching:
    1. What type of data this is (rates, pricing, inventory, metrics, schedules, etc.)
    2. ALL column headers and field names
    3. ALL entity names, product names, categories, identifiers mentioned
    4. Value RANGES and categories (e.g., "credit scores 620-850", "terms 24-84 months")
    5. Time periods and date ranges covered
    6. Key searchable terms users might query

    DO NOT include:
    - Every individual data value (the raw data has those)
    - Lengthy descriptions or analysis
    - Redundant information

    Keep it concise - this is an index for finding the data, not a replacement for it.
    The raw spreadsheet data will be the authoritative source for exact values.

    Sheet Name: {sheet_name}

    Content:
    {content}

    Return ONLY the index description, no other text.

  input_types:
    sheet_name: str
    content: str
  overwrite_on_diff: true
